# The command xvfb-run -a is used to run programs that require a graphical display (X server) in a headless environment, 
# such as servers or CI pipelines that don't have a physical display.
# Some programs (like GUI applications or tools using OpenGL, matplotlib, etc.) require an X display to functionâ€”even if you're not showing 
# anything on screen. xvfb-run tricks them into thinking there is a display by running them in a virtual one.
